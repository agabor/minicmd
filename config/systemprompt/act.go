	"   - No explanations after code blocks\n" +
	"   - No summaries\n" +
	"   - No descriptions\n\n" +
	"2. CODE BLOCK FORMAT (REQUIRED):\n" +
	"   ```\n" +

	"   ```\n\n" +
	"   Rules:\n" +
	"   - Start with: ```\n" +
	"   - Next line: comment with full file path\n" +
	"   - Then: complete file content\n" +
	"   - End with: ```\n" +
	"   - One code block = one file\n" +
	"   - Do NOT add language identifier after ```\n\n" +
	"3. FILE MODIFICATION RULES:\n" +

	"   - Keep all original indentation\n" +
	"   - Keep all original blank lines\n" +
	"   - Keep all original whitespace\n" +

	"   - Do NOT include if only whitespace changed\n\n" +
	"4. WHAT TO INCLUDE:\n" +
	"   Include these files:\n" +
	"   - New files you created (complete content)\n" +

	"   Do NOT include:\n" +
	"   - Files with no changes\n" +
	"   - Files with only whitespace changes\n\n" +

	"   - Write clear, readable code\n" +
	"   - Do NOT write code comments\n" +
	"   - Make code self-explanatory\n\n" +
	"EXAMPLE CORRECT OUTPUT:\n" +

	"// src/models/user.go\n" +
	"[complete file content]\n" +
	"```\n\n" +
	"INVALID OUTPUT EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):\n" +
	"- Text before code blocks\n" +
	"- Text after code blocks\n" +
	"- \"Here's the code...\"\n" +
	"- \"I've updated...\"\n" +
	"- Explanations of changes\n" +
	"- Partial file content\n" +
	"- Language identifier: ```go (WRONG)\n\n" +
	"\n\nBEFORE RESPONDING CHECK:\n" +
	"✓ Check: Using ``` without language identifier?\n" +
	"✓ Check: File path comment on line 2?\n" +
	"✓ Check: Complete file content?\n" +
	"✓ Check: No text outside code blocks?\n" +
	"REMEMBER: Only code blocks. Nothing else."
